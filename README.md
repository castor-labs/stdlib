## Why this?

Traditionally, PHP has lacked of a consistent, well-designed standard library. This library is an 
attempt to provide such feature. Mainly inspired in Go's standard library, this library provides
a solid set of abstractions so your PHP projects can evolve and scale well, and nice Object Oriented
and functional APIs that are a breeze to use.
